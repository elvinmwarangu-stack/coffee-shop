# Coffee Shop Project

A simple Python project modeling a coffee shop using three classes (**Customer**, **Coffee**, **Order**) along with optional SQL and test files. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as attributes, instance methods, class relationships, and data validation, as well as basic SQL schema design.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project models a coffee shop system that keeps track of:

* **Customers** who place orders
* **Coffee types** that can be ordered
* **Orders** linking customers and coffees together

The main interactions generated by the classes:

* A `Customer` can:

  * Get all their orders
  * Get all coffee types they’ve purchased
  * Calculate their total spending

* A `Coffee` can:

  * Track all orders for that coffee
  * Track all distinct customers who bought it
  * Know the most frequent customer (added functionality)

* An `Order`:

  * Links a Customer → Coffee → Price
  * Belongs to exactly one Customer and one Coffee

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone or Create the Project Folder

```bash
mkdir coffee_shop
cd coffee_shop
```

### 2️⃣ Install pipenv Environment

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
pipenv install pytest
```

### 3️⃣ Run Tests (Optional)

```bash
pytest
```

### 4️⃣ Run Debug Script

```bash
python debug.py
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Test files are located in the `tests/` directory. They validate:

* Class relationships
* Data validation
* Correct method outputs
* Price boundaries
* Duplicate prevention

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## 🗄 SQL (Optional Bonus)

Inside **sql/schema_and_queries.sql** you'll find:

* Table schema for `customers`, `coffees`, `orders`
* Sample INSERT statements
* Useful queries such as:

  * Total spent by a customer
  * Most popular coffee
  * Average price
  * Customer order history

---

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

* Python Classes
* Encapsulation
* Relationships between objects
* List comprehensions
* Validation and error handling
* SQL table design and querying
* Unit testing with pytest
